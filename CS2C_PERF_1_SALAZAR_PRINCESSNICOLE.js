        Differentiation of let, const, and var in JavaScript

        In JavaScript, variables can be declared using three keywords: let, var, and const.
    
        1. var
           - Function-scoped: Variables declared with var are accessible within the function they were declared in.
           - Can be redeclared and reassigned, which can lead to unexpected behavior if not managed carefully.
           - Allows hoisting: Variables can be used before they are declared, returning undefined.
           - Best practice: Generally discouraged in favor of let and const due to its quirks with scope and hoisting.

        2. let
           - Block-scoped: Variables declared with let are only accessible within the block they are defined in.
           - Can be reassigned but not redeclared within the same block, reducing the chances of errors.
           - Does not allow hoisting in the same way var does; accessing it before declaration results in a ReferenceError.
           - Best practice: Use let when the variableâ€™s value needs to change.

        3. const
           - Block-scoped: Similar to let, const variables are only accessible within the block they are defined in.
           - Cannot be reassigned or redeclared, making it ideal for constants.
           - While the reference to a const variable cannot change, if it is an object, the properties of that object can be modified.
           - Best practice: Use const by default for variables that should not change, and only use let when reassignment is necessary.

    varExample() {
        var x = 10;  // Variable declaration using var
        if (true) {
            var x = 20;  // var is function-scoped, so this modifies the same x variable
            console.log("Inside block with var: " + x); // Outputs: 20
        }
        console.log("Outside block with var: " + x); // Outputs: 20 (same x is modified)
    }

    // Example of let
    letExample() {
        let y = 10;  // Variable declaration using let
        if (true) {
            let y = 20;  // let is block-scoped, so this y is different from the outer y
            console.log("Inside block with let: " + y); // Outputs: 20 (different block-scoped y)
        }
        console.log("Outside block with let: " + y); // Outputs: 10 (outer y remains unchanged)
    }

    // Example of const
    constExample() {
        const z = 10;  // Variable declaration using const
        console.log("Initial const value: " + z); // Outputs: 10

        // Uncommenting the line below will throw an error because const cannot be reassigned.
        // z = 20;

        const obj = { name: "Nicole" };  // const with objects allows modification of properties.
        obj.name = "Salazar";
        console.log("Modified const object: " + obj.name); // Outputs: "Salazar"

        3. const: Block-scoped, cannot be reassigned or redeclared. Useful for constants or when reassignment is not needed.

    Concept of Falsy Values in JavaScript

    In JavaScript, a falsy value is a value that translates to false when evaluated in a Boolean context.
    There are exactly seven falsy values: false, 0, "", null, undefined, NaN, and document.all.
    These values are treated as false when used in conditional statements, which means they do not trigger the execution of the code block inside the statement.
    Understanding falsy values is crucial for controlling the flow of logic in your programs, as they can lead to unexpected behavior if not properly accounted for.
    For instance, if a variable is falsy, it can prevent certain actions from being taken or cause loops to terminate prematurely.
